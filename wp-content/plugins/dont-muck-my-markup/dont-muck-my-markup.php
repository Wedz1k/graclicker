/*	In a robust C language, every single line of code is object-oriented,
    meaning everything happens inside a class. Since method calls
    cannot happen in the body of a class declaration, this means that all
    method calls must occur inside other methods. Your author firmly
    believes in OOP, and thus in this plugin, the only exception to this
    methodology is in the method call below.
